'''Add a script called run.py in /directory that has path  and edit it like this:

import programs.my_python_program
programs.my_python_program.main()

(replace main() with your equivalent method in my_python_program.)
Go to /home/bodacydo/work/project
Run run.py
Explanation: Since python appends to PYTHONPATH the path of the script from which it runs, running run.py will append /home/bodacydo/work/project. And voil√†, import foo.tasks will be found.'''
